**Abstract:**   
Calcium (Ca2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in cardiac myocytes exhibits high
gain and is graded. These properties result from local control of Ca2+
release. Existing local control models of Ca2+ release in which interactions
between L-Type Ca2+ channels (LCCs) and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release
channels (RyRs) are simulated stochastically are able to reconstruct these
properties, but only at high computational cost. Here we present a general
analytical approach for deriving simplified models of local control of CICR,
consisting of low-dimensional systems of coupled ordinary differential
equations, from these more complex local control models in which LCC-RyR
interactions are simulated stochastically. The resulting model, referred to as
the coupled LCC-RyR gating model, successfully reproduces a range of
experimental data, including L-Type Ca2+ current in response to voltage-clamp
stimuli, inactivation of LCC current with and without Ca2+ release from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum, voltage-dependence of excitation-contraction coupling
gain, graded release, and the force-frequency relationship. The model does so
with low computational cost.
